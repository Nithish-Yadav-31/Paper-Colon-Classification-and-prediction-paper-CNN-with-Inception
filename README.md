Colon cancer is progressively increasing, significantly impacting human health. Traditionally, the classification and detection of colon cancer cells in Whole Slide Images (WSI) by a pathologist can take one to two weeks. However, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing this process, offering automation for more efficient and accurate analysis of pathology images. In this context, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) utilizing transfer learning has been proposed for various classifications such as tumor, stroma, complex, lymphocytes, debris, mucosa, adipose tissue, and empty regions, achieving an impressive 97% accuracy. Additionally, a proposed deep learning model, YOLOv8, has demonstrated a 90% accuracy in detecting colon cancer cells in pathology images. Specifically, the transfer learning approach employs the Inception Net model to rapidly and accurately identify different types of colon cancer cells, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the diagnostic process.
